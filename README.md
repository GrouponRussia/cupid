# Cupid gem â€” Create, organize and send emails through Exact Target

Send love, not war. This version of cupid can only work with ET SOAP API with s4.

Sponsored by Evil Martians <http://evilmartians.com>

## Usage

Get a new cupid object for every account you want to work with (usually
it's the only one):

``` ruby
  Cupid::MyAccount = Cupid.new :username, :password, :account
```

Now you can send requests to ExactTarget through this object.

Small example:

``` ruby
  Cupid::MyAccount.tap do |it|
    list = it.lists.last
    new_email = it.create_email :subject, :body
    it.create_delivery list, new_email
    it.delete_emails *it.emails
  end
```

There is much more underneath. See specs for some examples.

## Installation

Puts this line into `Gemfile` then run `$ bundle`:

``` ruby
gem 'cupid'
```

Or if you are old-school Rails 2 developer put this into `config/environment.rb` and run `$ rake gems:install`:

``` ruby
config.gem 'cupid'
```

Or manually install cupid gem: `$ gem install cupid`
