# Cupid gem â€” Create, organize and send emails through Exact Target

Send love, not war. This version of cupid can only work with ET SOAP API with s4.

Sponsored by Evil Martians <http://evilmartians.com>

## Usage

Add cupid initializer to your config/initializers and now there only two parameters to configure:

``` ruby
Cupid.configure do |config|
  config.username = 'username'
  config.password = 'password'
end
```

After that you can create Cupid::Session object and do some stuff through it:

``` ruby
# Creating session
et_translator = Cupid::Session.new

# Retrieving folders for not default account (your_account_id can be nil - default account on ET)
folders = et_translator.retrieve_email_folders(your_account_id)

# Creating new folder
# not required fields for folder: description, content_type, is_active, is_editable, allow_children
new_folder_id = et_translator.create_folder('title', :parent => parent_directory_id, :client_id => your_account_id)

# Creating new email
# not required fields for email: email_type, is_html_paste, character_set, name, description, category_id
new_email_id = et_translator.create_email('subject', 'body', :client_id => your_account_id, :category_id => new_folder_id)

# Creating new subscriber
# not required fields for subscriber: first_name, last_name, client_id
new_subscriber_id = et_translator.create_subscriber('email@email.com')
```

## Installation

Puts this line into `Gemfile` then run `$ bundle`:

``` ruby
gem 'cupid', '0.0.6'
```

Or if you are old-school Rails 2 developer put this into `config/environment.rb` and run `$ rake gems:install`:

``` ruby
config.gem 'cupid', :version => '0.0.6'
```

Or manually install cupid gem: `$ gem install cupid`
